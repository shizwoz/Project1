Rar Salin
70th Light of the Bug Season in the 40th Line of Oza

Words of the Goddess
Cleansings II 17:4-5 
When presented with opportunity and welcoming it is 
wise to turn away from those that would corrupt your 
mind. But if one of and within your mind reaches out 
to you, accept it, and be at peace knowing I would 
never lie.

Praise Oza! 

That is all I can really say. For today I have 
finally been accepted into the Order. I am now of 
the Holy Priesthood. Priest Salin they will say! 
It is strange feeling  to be sure. I have this pressure
in my chest and my tears will not stop. Such a blessing! 
I never thought that I would get here. Everything I had 
to do was very much worth it. And the way they all 
smiled at me as I walked through the streets and oh 
how the sun felt. Was it always that bright? Surely not! 
That is the Goddess’ blessing I feel on my skin and in 
my heart. 

And laying on my lap is the proof that it is all not 
an illusion! The Seastone necklace and the priest robes. 
The stone so beautiful and cool to the touch with its 
natural blues and reds. And the robes made from the soft 
wool of the rare green sheepfish. Tomorrow I will put 
them on for the first time and truly be a  Priest. I 
wonder what it will be like inside the sanctuary. They 
say that inside is a mural depicting the Goddess in all 
Her glory. I cannot wait. In fact I do not think I will 
be able to sleep! My hands  are shaking and my legs want 
to run. So I will go out into the night and jump around 
as a child and then pray myself to sleep when I return. 

Hopefully I will not wake the others.";

Words of the Goddess
Waterwords 1:1
In the beginning She had come from our dreams and like,
as if in response, Her servants came from the shifting 
dreamlike waters.

Brother surprised me again this day! He joined with us once 
more for the Honoring Ceremonies. I had heard that lately 
he had been talking to some of the Priests but he never 
struck me as one of faith. But I am so happy nevertheless! 
His hiding nature and keeping to himself always and really 
only appearing to give us his hunt for dinner was becoming 
heartbreaking for us. But now he is smiling more and 
laughing. Oza be praised! It is actually like I have a 
brother now. 

I cannot hold my excitement for the future days and seeing 
what he will become and what he will bring to the family. 
Perhaps he will become a Priest! Oh the honor he will bring!
Goddess Oza let the days be quick so that my vision will 
come to pass. ";

Words of the Goddess
Missions of the Order 20:16-18
After we were done with the heretics we moved on to 
the next. Our hearts were weighed down by tears of 
bloodshed and the realization that there was so many 
faithless. We hope that Oza in our hearts grants them 
mercy in Her divine dreams. 

Last night I had the same dream and I am certain I 
will have it again tonight. Always the same. Me standing
on water in the middle of the sea with no land in sight 
all alone. And I heard the same woman’s voice but it was 
much closer this last time. Saying the same thing. “Come 
down into the water and let me hold you. Let me give you 
my love.” Then the tendrils of black reached up from the 
water and tried to grab me again but I woke up before they 
could. 

Most would say that these are visions of blessings I am 
sure but they are simply seeds of control. Because they 
were marching outside my room again. I am pretty sure it 
is because of those damned Priests that I am having these 
dreams. Chanting about their precious Oza while they march 
around the city and giving everyone these blessed visions. 
It will drive me mad. If they do it again I will demand for 
them to stop their incessant marching tomorrow.";

Jhime Urelio
1st Light of the Frost Season in the 20th Line of Oza

Words of the Goddess
The Inspired 3:94-95
We wanted to pass on our inspiration from the Goddess 
because of what She has done for us and so we give 
ourselves to Her entirely. It is only right that we 
honor Her through this.

Such a strange people. They speak the same language and 
yet it is like they are from a different world. Everything 
is different here but it is not bad at all. They are kind 
to Jhime. They give me food and place to sleep during the 
cold times. Very kind indeed. Especially those spirit 
fathers. Or Priests they say. Interesting spirit the spirit
fathers love here. Oza. Not like any spirit I have heard of
in my travels. And even the adorning the spirit fathers 
cloak are very spirit loving here. I feel the love fires 
everywhere! 

Jhime will learn more about this spirit Oza. Maybe it will 
fill me with love fires also! So exciting this new place. ";

Words of the Goddess
The Shaping 5:10-11
She reached through our hearts into the dying earth and 
poured into it Her love. And the ground burst with life
and sustenance.

Thank Oza! The rains have returned and my crops are 
being given life again! I hear the sky opening up 
and sharing its life blood. I should not have waited 
so long to call upon the Priests to come bless the 
land. I should have figured that something was wrong
when there hadn’t been rain for so long. To think 
that the reason was that I had incurred the Great 
Goddess’ wrath. I feel so ashamed. I must fix my 
mistake and the Priests say it is easy to do all I
have to do is devote myself to Oza more. And so now
everyday forth I vow to go to the honoring ceremony
and march with my people! Praise Oza the Giver of 
Life! Already I can feel Her reaching into my life 
and giving me Her blessings! I will share this 
feeling with my wife and children and they will 
be blessed as well!";
